# Conductor Templates

This directory contains default templates used during `/conductor:setup`.

## Available Templates

### `workflow.md`

The default development workflow template that defines:

- **Guiding Principles**: Core development philosophy (TDD, planning, coverage)
- **Task Workflow**: 11-step task lifecycle with TDD cycles
- **Phase Completion Protocol**: Verification and checkpointing process
- **Quality Gates**: Pre-commit checklist
- **Commit Guidelines**: Conventional commit format

### `code-styleguides/`

Language-specific code style guidelines that provide:

- **Naming Conventions**: Language-specific naming patterns (camelCase, snake_case, etc.)
- **Type Definitions**: Type annotation and definition patterns
- **Function Patterns**: How to structure functions, parameters, and returns
- **Error Handling**: Language-specific error handling best practices
- **Module Organization**: Import/export patterns and file structure
- **Testing Patterns**: Language-specific test patterns and examples

Available styleguides:
- `typescript.md` - TypeScript/TSX code style
- `python.md` - Python code style
- `go.md` - Go code style
- `javascript.md` - JavaScript/JSX code style
- `html-css.md` - HTML/CSS code style

## How Templates Are Used

During `/conductor:setup`:

1. **Workflow**: The `workflow.md` template is copied to `conductor/workflow.md`
2. **Code Styleguides**: Selected language styleguides are copied from `code-styleguides/` to `conductor/code_styleguides/`
   - Languages are detected from the tech stack
   - User can add additional languages if needed
   - Only selected languages are copied (not all 5)
3. **Customization**: User is prompted to customize settings (coverage target, commit strategy, etc.)
4. **Tech-specific**: Language-specific settings are added based on detected tech stack

## Customizing Templates

### Project-Level Overrides

After setup, you can edit conductor files directly:
- **Workflow**: Edit `conductor/workflow.md` for project-specific workflow changes
- **Styleguides**: Edit files in `conductor/code_styleguides/` for project-specific style rules

Changes are tracked in git and apply only to your project.

### Plugin-Level Customization

To customize the default templates for all projects:

1. Fork/clone the conductor plugin
2. Edit files in the `templates/` directory
3. Use your customized plugin with `--plugin-dir`

## Template Variables

Templates support these placeholders that are replaced during setup:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `{{project_name}}` | Name from product.md | "My App" |
| `{{coverage_target}}` | User-selected coverage | "80%" |
| `{{commit_strategy}}` | Per-task or per-phase | "task" |

## Files NOT in Templates

The following files are **generated dynamically** during setup based on user Q&A, not copied from templates:

- `product.md` - Product vision, goals, users (from interactive questions)
- `product-guidelines.md` - Brand voice, design standards (from interactive questions)
- `tech-stack.md` - Technologies, frameworks (from project detection + user input)
- `tracks.md` - Master track list (created empty, populated by `/conductor:new-track`)
